"# DynamicLifoAndFifo" 

Lifo and Fifo Implementations using primitive data structures, such as (fixed-sized) arrays which can grow or shrink dynamically to an arbitrary size.

• Add(number) - adds the number to the stack \n
• Get() - removes the next number from the stack and returns it \n
• IsEmpty() - returns whether the stack is empty
• Size() - returns the stack's size
• arraySize() - returns the original array size not the number of element's in array
• arraySize grows and shrinks dynamically according to insertions and deletions
